Title: Modular Shopping Cart Ecommerce application logic with transactional checkout and secure storage of customer purchase details.

A backend-driven shopping cart system architected with core Python and secure SQLite database storage for the purpose of redesigning the cart system with dynamic updates in Django-powered robust and scalable backend design and development.
This project demonstrates modular design, transactional integrity, and real-time data visibility—ideal for showcasing consultative impact and scalable architecture in SDE and software consulting roles.

Project Overview
This system was developed through a structured SDLC approach:
- Requirements Analysis: Identified core user workflows—cart operations, user management, and order tracking.
- System Design: Architected encapsulated modules with clear separation of concerns and reusable components.
- Implementation: Developed Python-based modules with SQLite integration for persistent storage and transactional workflows.
- Testing & Validation: Verified CRUD operations, checkout integrity, and dashboard accuracy across edge cases.
- Deployment & Documentation: Packaged for local execution with schema initialization and CLI-based interaction.
